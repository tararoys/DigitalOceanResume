Overview
--------
I have a passion for explaining technical concepts clearly and in detail, which is why I love Digital Ocean tutorials. Digital Ocean tutorials are the best "How To Manage Your Server" resources on the web, and I want to help make them better.  I have five years experience writing user manuals and tutorials for open source projects.  I also have experience using Digital Ocean servers to deploy rails apps and manage my personal website. I welcome the opportunity to make Digital Ocean tutorials even better. 

Experience
----------

### Tutorial Series: "How To Publish on Amazon Kindle"

April 2014 - May 2014 

In April 2014, I learned how to publish a book on Amazon Kindle.
I wrote a book detailing every step of the publishing process. The book is [published on my blog](
http://tararoys.com/exporting-draft-to-kindle-direct-publishing) and on [Amazon.com]( http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MD5KNNE)

During this project, I learned a about a lot of writing process
technologies:

-  I experimented with the Draftin.com writing tool.
-  I learned how to set up a Jekyll Blog on a Digital Ocean server.
-  I publish a book on Amazon Kindle

### Writing The Apophysis User Manual 

January 2011 - April 2014

In April 2014, I began the process of publishing the Apophysis User Manual, based on a series of tutorials I had written. Apophysis is open source software that is incredibly hard to learn because of the lack of good documentation. As a personal project, I wrote good, beginner-level documentation so that people could learn how to make fractals with Apophysis. The book is called ["Make Fractals With Apophysis"](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JSZB04S) and is published on Amazon Kindle.

 During this project, I investigated several publishing tools: 
 
-  I converted my tutorials from Docbook XML to Markdown
-  I used several command line tools like Pandoc  and Kindlegen to convert my book from one format
    to another.

###Rails App: Grocer Ease 

In April 2014, I worked with a team of four people to create [GrocerEase](www.grocer-ease.com), a Rails application that makes it easier to plan and shop for healthy meals. 

During this project, I was in charge of testing and deploying the app:

- I created single-command continuous deployment process
- I deployed a node.js server to pull the latest changes from a github repository
- I learned how to do integration tests with capybara
